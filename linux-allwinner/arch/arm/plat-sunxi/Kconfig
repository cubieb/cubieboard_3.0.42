config SUNXI_SCALING_MIN
	int "Minimum clockspeed for the cpu governor"
	default "60"
	help
	  The (default) minimum clockspeed the cpu scaling governor may use,
	  the lowest the sunxi cpu core can go is 60 MHz, which is quite slow,
	  so you may wish to set a somewhat higher minimum speed. 408 Mhz is
	  the last speed at the lowest voltage setting and as such is a good
	  value to use.
